# Alarm Timer Project

## Description
This is a Python-based alarm timer that allows users to set an alarm with a custom delay (in seconds). The program will countdown the time until the alarm is triggered, and then it will play a specified sound to notify the user. 

## Features
- **Set Alarm with Custom Delay**: Users can set an alarm by specifying a time delay in seconds.
- **Countdown Timer**: Displays a countdown showing the remaining time until the alarm rings.
- **Custom Alarm Sound**: Users can specify the sound file (e.g., MP3) that will play when the alarm goes off.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
